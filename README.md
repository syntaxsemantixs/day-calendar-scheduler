# day-calendar-scheduler
A nice way to schedule your day for showing all  past present and future events.

## Description

My motivation for this project was to practice more local storage and start using 3rd party API's. For this project I had to learn the syntax of both jQuery and bootstrap. jQuery has a much simpler syntax compared to the more vanilla version of JavaScript. Bootstrap is a nice tool to use for quick creation of forms and manipulating visual aspects of this project. This project solves the issue of manipulating elements and class to show different times throughout a work schedule. Whether it is in the past, present or future. Also I was able to create a function to show when the save button is pressed. In the end I learned a lot of valuable skills with 3rd party API's in order to create this scheduler.
